This is an attempt to make writing a daily habit and replace/reroute any urge to post on social media. It's a DIY, one-way, non-interactive microblogging platform (a text file posted on my website: mwtext.com). And occasionally a changelog for the main site. Partially inspired by writtte on nohappynonsense.net and the twtxt microblogging service. I'm hoping to write at least one thing each day, but failure will be apparent. Uploading less often than that, though. Maybe once a week. Starting on April 20, 2023 and posting in reverse chronological order.

Friday. Famicase day! Spending the evening emulating old games and looking up old games to emulate.

Days flying by. Nice weather, though. Also having a blast with this forum stuff. Take the internet back, for real.

Spending the evening messing around with emulators and watching a video essay on V:TM-B.

Another busy day. Need to make time. Listening to a lot of IDLES lately. Do you hear that thunder?

Monday. Busy. Finished a book last night. And a game tonight. Feels good. Onto the next one.

Helped a couple of friends launch a new forum today. It was great! Forums are rad as hell.

Looking into creating an RSS feed. Might just do it manually, but seems difficult.

I've decided to move into the haunted castle on the back of the Windows 95 Solitaire cards.

Happy 4/20. Here again, posting stuff on the internet. I dunno, I just think it's neat.
