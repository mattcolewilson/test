This is an attempt to keep some sort of digital journal. Aiming for daily, but failure will be apparent. Probably uploading less often than that, though.

Feeling inspired to write. But I'm bad at it. It doesn't feel good to write, but it feels good to have written. For a while. And then I usually regret it. Part of the creative process, I guess. But ultimately, writing feels productive. And that's what's important, right? To feel productive. 

Thinking about things I want to put on my new site. Topics that I have things to say about. I have a long list, but when I try to flesh something out, it gets complicated. There's so much nuance to account for, at all times. Hard to know what all to cover. How comprehensive. Hard to know who I'm writing for (myself). Hard to know what's even worth sharing. Fear of an empty well. Easily distracted. Even without the old lineup of social media. There are just so many ways to waste time. So much content to consume. So many podcasts to listen to. Thinking of taking a break from it all. Unplug from the internet. Maybe on Saturdays, I go offline all day. Clear my head. Sit outside. 

That's the plan. This coming Saturday will be one without internet. During the day. (There's game night in the evening.) Compromise. Start small. Ease into it. No pressure.
