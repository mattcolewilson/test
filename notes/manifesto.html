<h1>Mini Manifesto</h1>
<p>↩ <a href="../index.html">Return to homepage</a></p>

<p>For better or worse, I love the internet. I love that there’s a tool that allows us to connect to one another in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways. It bums me out that it’s used for evil and that it’s a tool of exploitation for capitalism and that it’s a huge fucking mess. But it’s still a pretty neat thing, overall. The fact that we can set up little websites and express ourselves and that there’s a (small) chance that others may stumble across them and have these (often) tiny, fleeting connections is endlessly appealing. An entire ocean full of messages in bottles.</p>

<p>That’s what this thing is supposed to be, really. And there are three main motivations behind it:</p>

<h2>Oppose evil.</h2>
<p>This website’s primary purpose is to act as a personal alternative to social media. I’ll be honest and state that I’m a big ol’ hypocrite who still uses some social media on a regular basis. But I <i>fucking hate</i> it, dude. It’s purposefully manipulative, exploitative, and harmful. The mainstream platforms are intentionally designed to stoke outrage, spread misinformation, and maximally exploit its users in the name of profit. It sucks! And I don’t know of any meaningful way to fight those machines, aside from stepping away and finding alternatives. And this, having a personal website, is the simplest and oldest alternative there is.</p>

<h2>Put stuff out there.</h2>
<p>It often feels that using those platforms is the only way to get your thoughts out there. But it’s not true! There are whole other universes outside the walled garden of social media. And you can pretty easily build your own spaces and use them to share whatever you want. And, best of all, you can make these spaces accessible to anyone with an internet connection, without requiring them to login and be used and abused by evil mega corporations. It’s nice!</p>

<h2>Connect with others.</h2>
<p>I like the idea of being one of those messages in a bottle. I could easily just write this stuff in a private journal. But the act of putting it on a publicly-accessible website necessarily means that I value the idea of someone else finding it. And what could possibly motivate that behavior aside from the desire to connect with other people? (Even if it’s extremely rare and a completely one-way connection.) Most of us have a baked-in desire to connect with others, and that’s good. That’s what we’re doing here. My contact information is on the homepage.</p>

<p>—</p>

<p>Using the word “manifesto” feels a little dramatic when explaining what you’re doing with a personal website. But I’m keeping in line with the tradition of the independent web. <i>This is a public declaration of my intentions.</i> I’ll be the first to admit that this is just a silly, little website. (And I can’t even guarantee that it will be updated regularly or even stay online for a long period of time, lol.) But it’s <i>my</i> silly, little website — to do with what I will, independently. Free from algorithms and advertisements. Uncontrolled by corporations. Created by a human being.</p>

<p>It’s a tiny protest against the status quo of the social internet. (An infinitely tiny protest, sure, but it’s still <i>something</i>.) It’s an encouragement that you can do this too, if you want. It’s a reminder that the things you like about social media can be achieved without social media.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
