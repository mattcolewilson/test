<h1>Manifesto</h1>
<p>↩ <a href="../index.html">Return to homepage</a></p>

<p>For better or worse, I love the internet. I love that there’s a tool that allows us to connect to one another in all sorts of weird and wonderful ways. The fact that we can set up little websites and express ourselves. And that there’s a chance that others may stumble across them and have these tiny, fleeting connections. It's all endlessly appealing. An entire ocean full of messages in bottles. How beautiful!</p>

<p>But for the majority of today’s internet users, this endless ocean has been replaced by an incredibly small handful of social media platforms. (I’m talking like three or four). And these platforms have wreaked havoc on the internet ecosystem, our brains, and our daily lives. They exist to manipulate and exploit us in the name of profit. And, look, I don’t know about you guys, but I think this fucking <i>sucks</i>.</p>

<p>This little website is an attempt to push for a return to that ocean (no matter how futile). And there are three main motivations behind this push:</p>


<h2>Oppose evil.</h2>

<p>This website’s primary purpose is to act as a personal alternative to social media. I’ll be honest and state that I’m a big ol’ hypocrite who still uses some social media on a regular basis. But I’m not into it! And am attempting to slowly peel myself away. These platforms are intentionally designed to stoke outrage, spread misinformation, and maximally exploit their users. It's fucked up. And I don’t know of any meaningful way to fight these machines, aside from stepping away and finding alternatives. And this, having a personal website, is the simplest and oldest alternative there is.</p>

<p>This isn't meant to cast judgment on anyone that uses social media. I'm one of you! And I realize it's the only way to stay in touch with certain people and is necessary for many careers and that there are a whole multitude of other reasons that can make putting up with the evil worth it. But this site, for me, is meant to serve as an alternative that stands in opposition to these platforms.</p>

<h2>Regain independence.</h2>

<p>I’m not someone who thinks it’s important that everything I post stays online in perpetuity. Part of the fun of all of this, to me, is its ephemeral nature. But it’s wild that we put so much trust in corporations when it comes to the content we put online. A CEO somewhere can decide that a platform isn’t making them enough money and huge swaths of user content can be gone in a flash. Words, photos, videos, memories, memorials. All outside of your control. And it’s wild that we trade so much for the simple privilege of posting content online. We allow our data to be harvested and our behavior to be monitored. We allow ourselves to be psychologically manipulated and experimented upon. And we allow misinformation (and occasionally hate speech) to be shoved in our faces.</p>

<p>We’ve lost control of the content we post and we’re quickly losing control of the content we see. More and more of what you are exposed to on social media is decided by an inhuman algorithm. It’s getting harder and harder to see <i>only</i> the content from the people you care about. But how can I go about fighting all of this? How can I take back control of what I share and what I see? Again, the only method I know is to disengage and do my own thing, separate from these platforms and their control.</p>

<h2>Connect with others.</h2>

<p>I could easily just log off and write this stuff in a private journal. But the act of putting it on a publicly-accessible website means that I value the idea of someone else finding it. And what could possibly motivate that behavior aside from the desire to connect with other people? (Even if it’s an extremely rare and completely one-way connection.) Most of us have a baked-in desire to express ourselves and connect with others, and that’s good. That’s what we’re all trying to do here. </p>

<p>Your mileage may vary, but I find social media to be incredibly alienating a lot of the time. And if social media is not meaningfully fulfilling the one thing that it promises (social connection), then what the hell are we doing here? All this to say, I’m deciding (attempting) to pursue alternatives.</p>

<p>Anyway, my contact information is on the homepage.</p>

<p>— — —</p>

<p>Using the word “manifesto” feels a little dramatic when explaining what you’re doing with a personal website. But I’m keeping in line with the tradition of the independent web. <i>This is a public declaration of my intentions.</i> I’ll be the first to admit that this is just a silly little website. (And I can’t even guarantee that it will be updated regularly or even stay online for a long period of time, lol.) But it’s <i>my</i> silly little website — to do with what I will, independently. Free from algorithms and advertisements. Uncontrolled by corporations. Created by a human being.</p>

<p>It’s a tiny protest against the status quo of the social internet. (An infinitely tiny protest, sure, but it’s still <i>something</i>.) It’s an encouragement that you can do this too, if you want. It’s a reminder that the things you like and hope to gain from social media can be achieved without social media.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
