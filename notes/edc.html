<p>It's fun to read about the things people use every day. Here's a rundown of my stuff. Updated: 2023-04-22.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Glasses</h2>
<p>I wear the standard, square-ish, black plastic frames. My last pair was transparent plastic and I loved the way those looked, but I went back to black for whatever reason. (Old habits.) I've been wearing glasses for decades, but I think I'm going to try contacts when it's time to get a new prescription. I like glasses, but they're kind of a pain. Always dirty. And needing to swap back and forth between subscription sunglasses is very inconvenient.</p>

<h2>Headphones</h2>
<p>I don't actually carry these with me. But I do use them pretty much every day, so it seems worth noting here. I have some beater earbuds for jogging, but mostly use black JVC Flats. They're cheap, lightweight, comfortable, and sound great for the price. It feels like headphones have been figured out. (I'm not an audiophile.) And maybe this is a luddite take, but I will never buy a pair of wireless headphones.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Keys</h2>
<p>House key, mailbox key, car key. Pretty standard stuff. I do have a cool carabiner alternative, but I have no memory of where I bought it from. It's pretty "minimalist" and is made from a single piece of metal. Just a hook shape, with some curves to prevent unwanted removal, and a hole to attach a keyring. No moving parts. Seems pretty much unbreakable. Big fan of this thing. I also have two rabies vaccination tags that belonged to my dogs (RIP). Their names were engraved into each one by the vet.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Notebook</h2>
<p>I've been a Field Notes user for a long time, but I've recently discovered the Muji Passport Memo notebook, which I think I like even more. They're a little smaller and even more pocket friendly. They're also plain - nothing on the cover, and no jokes or other text on the inside. Solid color covers and grid paper. Kind of perfect. I'll probably make the switch, if I ever get through all of the unused Field Notes I have laying around.</p>

<p>I also use a black canvas notebook cover from Metier Life. It holds multiple (currently two) notebooks, a pen, and has a small pocket for other stuff. The pocket is currently filled with a Taco Bell coupon, a trail map, an airline ticket stub, two paint swatches, and a Pumpkinhead Topps trading card.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Phone</h2>
<p>I have a Samsung Galaxy. It's fine. I've been pretty good about not using social media on my phone, aside from Discord (if that counts). I mainly use it for podcasts, texting, GPS, and looking stuff up on the internet. The phone is blue and I use a transparent plastic case, which was honestly a huge mistake. (It's yellowed and looks pretty gross. I need to replace it.) On the back, in the top-right corner, visible through the clear case, is a small sticker from Vacaliebres (one of my favorite designers).</p>
<hr>
<h2>Wallet</h2>
<p>My wallet is a black, lightweight, minimalist bifold from Huskk. Vegan, made of soft microfiber, with plastic inserts that give it structure and block RFID. Perfectly small and fits in my front pocket, but still functions like a normal bifold. It looks like it's no longer available, unfortunately. </p>
<hr>
<h2>Watch</h2>
<p>I have a small collection of wristwatches that I cycle through (and usually have one on a wishlist somewhere). They are mostly digital Casios. My regular watch is an all-black G-Shock DW5600BB-1. I love that it looks somewhat minimalist (for a G-Shock, at least) but is also bulky and kinda dumb. It looks like something that would go an action figure, but blown up to human size.</p>

<p>I also have a metal A158WA-1DF that I wear to the office sometimes, but it's a little uncomfortable. Slides around, scratches stuff, and pulls hair. I prefer a softer resin/plastic band. And there's also the analogue MW240-1BV, which is probably the best looking watch that's ever been made. I've tried a few other watches from Nixon and Swatch. But nothing can beat a Casio.</p>
