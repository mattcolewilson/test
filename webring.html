<b>BSTRDS Network</b>

<p>
The BSTRDS Network is a small webring for people who feel alienated by the mainstream internet and social media landscape. This is a modest attempt to encourage and connect with likeminded netizens and carve out a small corner of cyberspace for us to share.</p>

<p>In order to be accepted, your site must meet the following criteria:</p>

<p><b>Your content is personal and non-commercial.</b><br>
This is not a place for storefronts or portfolios. Your site can link to a professional presence, but all sites listed here should be personal and non-commercial in nature.</p>

<p><b>Your site rejects the mainstream internet.</b><br>
This is not a place for Wordpress or Squarespace websites. Your site should have some element of hand-made creation and ideally does not rely on corporations. Static HTML/CSS sites are preferred.</p>

<p><b>No bigots or centrists allowed.</b><br>
This is, unsurprisingly, the least negotiable rule.</p>

<p><b>Interested in joining?</b><br>

<p><b>The Fine Print</b><br>This is a webring by the loosest definition. There is no widget available and you aren’t even required to link back to this page. (Although, feel free!) If you are a purist who is bothered by the haphazard use of the term, feel free to refer to this as a “network” or a “club.” Please note, this is not a link directory. All sites listed here have asked to join and have been vetted to meet the above criteria.</p>
    
<p>The BSTRDS Network was launched in the Spring of 2023.</p>
