<p><b>BSTRDS Network</b></p>

<p>The BSTRDS Network is a small webring for people who feel alienated by the mainstream internet and social media landscape. This is a modest attempt to encourage and connect with likeminded netizens and carve out a small corner of cyberspace for us to share.</p>

<p><b>The Fine Print</b>
<p>This is a webring by the loosest definition. There is no widget available and you aren’t even required to link back to this page. (Although, feel 
free!) If you are a purist who is bothered by the haphazard use of the term, feel free to refer to this as a “network” or a “club.” Please note, 
this is not a link directory. All sites listed here have asked to join and have been vetted to meet the above criteria.</p>

<p><i>The BSTRDS Network was launched in the Spring of 2023.</i></p>
