# RECOMMENDED PODCASTS

Below are the podcasts that I listen to on a semi-regular basis. When it comes to total hours, I probably consume more podcasts than any other form of media. A great way to avoid the unbearable silence, you know! Listed in alphabetical order, with a brief description, for your convenience. 

—————————————

Abject Suffering

A comedy podcast from the Duckfeed network that's ostensibly about "bad" video games.

—————————————

Behind the Bastards

A great, comedic podcasts about the worst people to have ever lived. However, this is a cautious recommendation because this podcast has the worst ad breaks of all time.

—————————————

Best Quality Vacuum

Another podcast from the Duckfeed network. This one is an episode by episode analysis of Breaking Bad (and related properties). 

—————————————

Bonfirside Chat

An ultra deep dive into the Dark Souls series and related video games from the Duckfeed network.

Cane and Rinse

Wonderful analysis of video games from the UK.

—————————————

Another Dark Souls focused podcasts, featuring interviews with fans of the games.

Glasshouse Games (Defunct)

Great video game news and analysis from a leftist perspective. Now defunct, but still a great listen. 

—————————————

Halloweenies

A movie criticism podcast focusing on horror franchises. 

—————————————

Henry and Heidi (Defunct)

Henry Rollins and longtime assistant Heidi tell random stories. Very sporadic and hasn't had a new episode in years, but I can't bring myself to unsubscribe. 

—————————————

Insert Credit

Another video game podcast! A little loose, but features a great insightful cast, including personal favorite Tim Rogers. 

—————————————

The Losers' Club

The best Stephen King podcast. A sister show to Halloweenies. 

—————————————

Office Hours with Tim Heidecker

Tim Heidecker is probably my favorite celebrity. I never miss an episode of this very silly show.

An excellent horror movie podcast. 

—————————————

Retronauts

The OG video game analysis podcast from veteran video game journalists. 

—————————————

Everything to Guppy

Another Duckfeed show that's ostensibly about the game The Binding of Isaac but is actually about improv comedy and tangents. 

—————————————

The Sloppy Boys

A deep dive into the drinks that you love! Three very funny dudes talking about booze.

More comedy stuff from Comedy Bang! Bang! alum. 

—————————————

Video Game History Hour

The podcast of the Video Game History Foundation. Very cool stories and insights into the world of games preservation.

A podcast focused on horror video games. This show has been a bit of a roller coaster with a drastic format change and then an expansion into a network. But the main host is great and it continues to improve. Recommended!
