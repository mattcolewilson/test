<p>Every time I start a new website, I feel the need to explain myself. To kick things off with a stated purpose, a reason for being, some context, and maybe even a welcome message. Essentially, I’m starting this site because I have a deep love for independent, personal websites. I’m an advocate for leaving corporate social media and returning to the personal internet. And there’s no better way to advocate than to build.</p>

<p>It’s a weird time to be online in 2023. Most of the big social media sites are imploding and a huge amount of users are being scattered to the wind. I deleted my Twitter account after it came under new ownership in late 2022 and went rapidly downhill. I know it’s always had a negative reputation, but Twitter had been my platform of choice for a decade, and it sucked to leave under those circumstances. However, my enthusiasm for the indie web had been growing for the last several years, so I knew there were many other worlds to explore. And watching the last sliver of social media that I cared about go up in flames was motivating, in a way.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been spending more and more time in independent internet spaces. Surfing web rings, checking forums, reading people’s thoughts, watching people make stuff. It’s rad. I highly recommend it. And I’ve also been spending a good chunk of this newly found free time playing video games. And what happens when you have a renewed interest in the personal internet and a lifelong love of video games? Well, you make a website about it!</p>

<p>I’ve been playing games regularly for around three decades now. I started out with the home Pong console, which my parents had for unknown reasons. (They weren’t really into video games, so I’m not sure how they ended up with it. The only game my dad ever showed any interest in was Duck Hunt, and that was only for a few minutes. My mom would play Super Mario Kart and Zombies Ate My Neighbors with me, but very little else.)</p>

<p>Aside from regularly telling me to go play outside, my parents always seemed cool with my gaming obsession. We weren’t a wealthy family, but over the years they managed to surprise me over and over again with new consoles for Christmases and birthdays. My first console was a Nintendo Entertainment System — then Super Nintendo, Nintendo 64, Playstation, and the Playstation 2 accordingly. (Although, I now know that the used PS1 my mom bought me had been stolen in a home burglary. Maybe a story for another time.)</p>

<p>I was also lucky to grow up with parents who were hands off when it came to what I was allowed to play. (A rare benefit of a broken home, I guess you could say!) On most weekends, I could rent a game from our local rental place. Aside from the small-town store’s limited collection, nothing was off limits. Kid-me could experience all of the Mortal Kombat 2 fatalities that I wanted and shoot demons to my little heart’s content. I even had the treasured experience of playing Resident Evil way too young and being so terrified by the first zombie encounter that I turned it off and didn’t play it anymore, sacrificing my one rental opportunity for that weekend (which was a big deal at the time). </p>

<p>When it came time to use my own money to support my hobby, I found myself happy remaining in the sixth generation of video games as the industry continued to move forward without me. As a student working part time, I couldn’t afford the $400 to $500 for the latest console. So the PS2 ended up carrying me through both high school and the entirety of college. I also began to gravitate towards retro games. (If you can believe it, there was a time when retro games were an inexpensive option.)</p>

<p>This period of time gave me a deeper appreciation for older games, allowed me to explore niche titles, and taught me to be content with avoiding hype cycles and the pressures to get the latest and greatest. I’ve essentially kept this mindset ever since, with occasional exceptions like getting the Nintendo Switch a year after launch and jumping into certain new releases (like the incredibly-special Elden Ring). </p>

<p>These days, I’m mostly a PC gamer. I tend to prefer single-player games and (thanks to that formative experience with Resident Evil) I’m a huge fan of survival horror. I also still lean towards retro games (using the 10-year benchmark set in stone by Retronauts). This site will likely focus on things like that. Older stuff, spooky stuff, and whatever else happens to get its hooks in me.</p>

<p>Like other gamers my age, I feel incredibly lucky to have grown up alongside video games. To see them go from 2D to 3D, from a niche hobby to the biggest industry in entertainment. It’s been a hell of a ride. And thanks to emulation and occasional retro releases, it’s incredible to have the ability to revisit past eras, to explore early successes and poke at evolutionary dead ends, and of course to occasionally wallow in the sweet pain of nostalgia. There continue to be ups and downs (and occasional crimes against humanity), but goddamn, do I love video games. And I’m excited to get into some specifics. <b>Welcome to BSSFGHT.</b></p>

<p><small>PS: I should also note a few of the direct inspirations behind this site. First, I’m a huge fan and supporter of the podcast Watch Out for Fireballs. I’ll essentially be adopting a condensed version of their area-by-area approach to analyzing video games. I find this the most effective way of talking about games — and the most enjoyable to consume, as it’s closer to re-experiencing than higher-level discussions. Of course, I’m attempting to put my own spin on this approach and am a man of much fewer words, but credit where it’s due.</small></p>

<p><small>When it comes to writing about games, my three favorite critics are Noah Caldwell-Gervais, Tim Rogers, and Kimini the Game-Eating She-Monster. I consider their work to be the high-water mark for video games analysis. I won’t be able to reach their heights, but I wanted to give them a shoutout as they are all huge inspirations. </small></p>

<p><small>PSS: Maybe I should elaborate on this actual website, too? It’s coded by hand using static HTML and CSS and is based on the grid system from referi.de. There are no (and will never be) any analytics, tracking code, or cookies for you to begrudgingly accept. Your data isn’t being harvested while you’re here and I think that’s good and important. </small></p>

<p><small>The site is also made to be incredibly lightweight and fast-loading. Images are black and white and heavily dithered to highlight a lower-fi aesthetic and to have smaller file sizes. (Plus, you’ve seen these screenshots before.) It’s not designed for mobile for a couple of reasons: One, I’m not sure how to adapt my current set-up to being more mobile-friendly. And two, I’m generally an advocate of visiting websites on computers instead of phones. (Smartphones have done massive damage to web design, in my opinion.) But I know many people prefer (or only have) mobile devices, so I’ll work on a better solution.</small></p>
